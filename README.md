# Hans Bacher Blog Wayback Index

Hans Bacher’s blog is/was an unmatched treasure trove of art and animation knowledge.
In August 2021, Hans announced he will no longer be posting to his blog, due to the deterioration of Wordpress’ blogging experience.

This repository serves as an index to backups of all his blog posts on the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/).
There exists an index by date that sorts blog posts chronologically, and there exists an index by tag that sorts blog posts by the tags assigned to them.
Hans did not use categories on his blog, so they are not reproduced here.

## Indices

* [By-Date](index-md/by-date/root.md)
* [By-Tag](index-md/by-tag/root.md)
